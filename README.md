# From Nand gates to Tetris implementation

This project's goal is to implement Tetris on a computer implemented from the ground up (starting with an abstraction of Nand gates). This project was done in 13 subprojects, each in their respective folder.

## 1 - Elementary logic gates

In this part, Hardware Description Language (HDL) was used to create 15 elementary logic gates: `Not`, `And`, `Or`, `Xor`, `Mux`, `DMux`, `Not16`, `And16`, `Or16`, `Mux16`, `Or8Way`, `Mux4Way16`, `Mux8Way16`, `DMux4Way`, `DMux8Way`. These gates were built either from the primitive `Nand` gate or from previously built gates.

Together with the .hdl files, there is also a .tst and a .cmp file for each logic gate. They are used to test and compare the functionality of the logic gate, respectively. To test a logic gate, simply open the Simulation tools folder and open the HardwareSimulator.bat
